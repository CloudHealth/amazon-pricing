= Amazon Web Services Pricing Ruby Gem

== About amazon-pricing

Amazon Web Services offers cloud-based on demand compute, storage and application services. Due to the number of services, and the number of pricing variables in each service, the pricing model is very complex. In addition, this pricing changes periodically. The amazon-pricing Ruby Gem is an interface library that simplifies the real-time retrieval of pricing information from Amazon.
